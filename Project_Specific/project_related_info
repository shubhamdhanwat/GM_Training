Charging Controller: This ECU (Electronic Control Unit) manages the core charging functionality.
It processes signals from the charging station (EVSE) to initiate and control the charging process for
 the high-voltage (HV) battery in the vehicle. It also handles contactor controls to switch between AC and 
 DC charging modes. Additionally, it deals with analog interfaces from the charging station to handle wakeup signals 
 and disable powerline communication within the vehicle.

 Charging Communication Controller:
 This ECU handles communication protocols with the charging station according to standards like DIN 70121/ISO15118-20.
 It's responsible for coordinating the transmission and reception of control commands between the charging controller 
 and the EVSE, facilitating secure transfer of certificates required for charging communication.
  It also executes SmartCharging applications to adjust charge schedules and parameters as needed.


Charging Communication Bridge: This ECU focuses on implementing the physical and data link layers for powerline communication 
between the EVSE and the vehicle. It manages communication handshakes and data bridging functionality 
to transfer Ethernet frames received from the EVSE to the Charging Communication Controller via 
the in-vehicle Ethernet communication link.


CC/CCU: Charging controller
-------------------------------------------------
-> It is infotainment ECU
-> ECU inside vehicle, dedicated for charging fucntio
-> Signalling, power control, economy, Handshakes
->ECU based on Classic autosar with implementation of DIN70121/ISO15118 -> relying on RTE
->later this all CCU work is done by VICM
--------------------------------------------------



VICM:
-------------------------------------------------
-> Charging control -> safety related
power electronics ->25ms
-> Responsible for charging
-> Interface over -> CAN
------------------------------------------------
It seems like you're describing two key components of the charging system for electric vehicles:
the Charging Controller/Charging Control Unit (CC/CCU) and the Vehicle Interface Control Module (VICM)

1. **Charging Controller/Charging Control Unit (CC/CCU)**:
   - It's an infotainment Electronic Control Unit (ECU) dedicated to handling charging functions within the vehicle.
   - Responsibilities include signaling, power control, managing charging economy, and performing handshakes with the charging infrastructure.
   - Implemented based on Classic AUTOSAR standards with support for DIN70121/ISO15118 protocols, typically relying on a Runtime Environment (RTE).
   - Later, these functionalities may be consolidated and managed by the Vehicle Interface Control Module (VICM).

2. **Vehicle Interface Control Module (VICM)**:
   - Responsible for charging control, especially safety-critical aspects related to power electronics, with a response time of around 25 milliseconds.
   - Manages the interface over the Controller Area Network (CAN), a standard communication protocol used in vehicles.

It seems like the CC/CCU initially handles the charging functionalities within the vehicle, but later, these responsibilities are transferred to the VICM. The VICM takes over the charging control and interfaces with the charging infrastructure through the CAN bus. This separation of duties ensures efficient and safe charging operations for electric vehicles.


CGM: Charging Gateway module
-------------------------------------------------
-> All various communication mediums intersects
i.e CAN, Ethernet
1. VICM <=====> CGM: Over CAN
2. VCU <=====> CGM: Over Ethernet

It acts as an central hub between CAN and Ethernet


Charging controller unit
CCU is devided into two parts
-------------------------------------------------
1. PLCM -> CAN to Eth
2. VCU -> Infotainment ECU -> porting DIN70121/ISO15118 into Android



VCU/CSM -> Vehicle communication unit/ Centre stack module
-------------------------------------------------
-> VCU is android platform
-> All functionality of CCU need to port it into android



-> Get it up and running on VCU
-> integration-> Bootup, state machine, lifecycle mngt, Persistancy, Dignostics, Handshakes, testing and VV
